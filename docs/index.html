                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Create or join a team of 2 to 5 people. Then choose from four different scenarios, each focusing on a separate aspect of doomsday preparedness and/or survival. Take your phones and travel to the starting point. An AI named <code>BORIS</code> will send your first instructions straight to your phone’s web browser. Work together to navigate the scenario and interpret <code>BORIS'</code> confounding statements. And do all of that accurately and promptly, as you’re being judged and timed.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>Following a confusing election cycle, we rose to power on our single-issue, semi-transparent platform of optional (mandatory) apocalypse survival training for all citizens. We believe—nay, know—that the world will end soon. And thanks to us, everybody in participating cities will be prepared.</p>
                    <p>But it's not enough to prepare for the end of the world. Can we make the end of the world a better place than the non-end of the world? Can we make it a friendlier place? Our answer is yes. After much refinement and many, many deadly errors, we have created the most perfectly friendly apocalypse survival training course around. We've made it accessible. We've made Apocalypse Made Easy!</p>   
                </div>

            <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
                <a href="#" class="accordion-title">Where is the training course available? And what's it cost?</a>
                <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                    <p>It hasn't launched yet. But it will soon be available in Vancouver and Kelowna, Canada. If you live anywhere other than those two places, you will sadly perish during the coming apocalypse due to lack of training. However, you may wish to sign up to get notified if the course comes to your city. Assuming the world isn’t over by then. It probably will be.</p>
                    <p>Since we're in beta, the cost is <span class="hooray">free!</span> We might even pay you to do it. But you will need mobile data. Each scenario uses about 0.005 gb, which is roughly equal to 1 streamed song. But the true cost is if you <em>don’t</em> participate and are ill-prepared for the end. That cost is astronomical.</p>
